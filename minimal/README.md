# Development guidelines.
For inclusion of any features, a PR may be created with a patch,
and a brief description of the problem and the fix.
The CI enforces a coding style guideline with autopep8 and
a script to detect trailing white spaces.

In case a PR encounters failures, the log would describe the location of
the offending line with a description of the problem.
